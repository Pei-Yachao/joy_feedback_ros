joy_feedback_ros
================

Create a simple ros node to allow setting rumble force feedback on a Xbox wired controller (and perhaps logitech F510 and anything else that is simlar) using fftest.c as a starting point.  Later try to integrate this into the proper https://github.com/ros-drivers/joystick_drivers repository.
