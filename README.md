joy_feedback_ros
================

Create a simple ros node to allow setting rumble force feedback on a Xbox wired controller (and perhaps logitech F510 and anything else that is simlar) using fftest.c as a starting point.  Later try to integrate this into the proper https://github.com/ros-drivers/joystick_drivers repository.

    - FF_CONSTANT can render constant force effects
    - FF_PERIODIC can render periodic effects with the following waveforms:
      - FF_SQUARE   square waveform
      - FF_TRIANGLE   triangle waveform
      - FF_SINE   sine waveform
      - FF_SAW_UP   sawtooth up waveform
      - FF_SAW_DOWN   sawtooth down waveform
      - FF_CUSTOM   custom waveform
    - FF_RAMP       can render ramp effects
    - FF_SPRING can simulate the presence of a spring
    - FF_FRICTION can simulate friction
    - FF_DAMPER can simulate damper effects
    - FF_RUMBLE rumble effects
    - FF_INERTIA    can simulate inertia
    - FF_GAIN gain is adjustable
    - FF_AUTOCENTER autocenter is adjustable

    Note: In most cases you should use FF_PERIODIC instead of FF_RUMBLE. All
      devices that support FF_RUMBLE support FF_PERIODIC (square, triangle,
      sine) and the other way around.

My current forcefeedback device:

    $ lsusb
    Bus 002 Device 003: ID 045e:028e Microsoft Corp. Xbox360 Controller


Test it with fftest:

The rumble effects worked:

    $ fftest /dev/input/event13
    Force feedback test program.
    HOLD FIRMLY YOUR WHEEL OR JOYSTICK TO PREVENT DAMAGES

    Device /dev/input/event13 opened
